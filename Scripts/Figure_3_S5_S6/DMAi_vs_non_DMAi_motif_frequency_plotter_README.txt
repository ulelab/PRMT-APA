The motif frequency analyses scripts located in this folder take fasta files as input, which contain the nucleotide sequences surrounding your polyA sites of interest. An example of how these files can be generated using the get_fasta_files.sh script is located in this folder, using bed files as input.

The create_pA_region_bedfiles_script.R r script located in this folder demonstrates how to generated bed files from polyA site csv files.
