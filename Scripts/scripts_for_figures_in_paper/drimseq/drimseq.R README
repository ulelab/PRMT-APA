##### README for drimseq.R script #####

Ensure all packages listed at the top of the script are installed and loaded on your system.

This script requires three sets of input files:

- count .bed files (such as those located within the Counts/ directory). These are generated by running the nf-quantseq pipeline on your 3' RNA-seq fastq files.
- a poly(A) site atlas file, titled merged_polya.filteredunique.annotated.bed (such as those found in the pA_atlases/ directory). This file is also generated by the nf-quantseq pipeline, and contains all poly(A) sites identified by the pipeline.
- a metadata .txt file containing information regarding the samples you want to input into DRIMSeq. An e.g of this file is present within this directory (drimseq_metadata_eg.txt). This file should be made up of two columns: SampleName (containing the name of each sample, including replicate information), and Condition (containing each condition that you want to compare).

The Count files used as input for this DRIMseq script to generate figures in 'PRMT activity promotes global 3â€™ UTR shortening in proliferating cells, Griffith et al., 2025', are all located with the counts/ directory within this directory, organised by Figure.

The CSV files generated by this script are required as input files for the classification_of_APA_events.R script within the APA_classification/ directory.
