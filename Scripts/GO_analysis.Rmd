1. Data preparation: List of genes identi􏰂ers, gene scores, list of di􏰁erentially expressed genes or a criteria for selecting genes based on their scores, as well as gene-to-GO annotations are all collected and stored in a single R object.
2. Running the enrichment tests: Using the object created in the 􏰂rst step the user can perform enrichment analysis using any feasible mixture of statistical tests and methods that deal with the GO topology.
3. Analysis of the results: The results obtained in the second step are analysed using summary functions and visualisation tools.
