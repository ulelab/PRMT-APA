##### README for APA classification steps as performed in 'PRMT activity promotes global 3â€™ UTR shortening in proliferating cells, Griffith et al., 2025' #########

1st step - get_UTR_and_splice_sites.sh
The first step in this proceess is to obtain bed files with information regarding splice sites and UTR regions. This can be achieved using the 'get_UTR_and_splice_sites.sh' script located within this directory. The script uses the GTFtools package (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/20/4806/6674500), and requires a gencode.v45.annotation.gtf as input. Therefore GTFtools must be downloaded and available on your system prior to running this script.
The UTR_regions_gencode_v45.bed and splice_regions_gencode_v45.bed (needs to be unzipped prior to use) generated by this script are required as input for the classification_of_APA_events.R script, and are located in /ulelab/PRMT-APA/Data/Figure_1_S1_S2_S3/classification_of_APA_bed_files/.

2nd step - annotate_pA_sites.sh
This script uses gene location information listed in gencode.v45.annotation.gtf to identify genes that overlap with your polyA sites of interest. gencode.v45.annotation.gtf is required as input along with the all_polyA_sites_SAMPLE_NAME_with_change_in_usage.csv CSV files generated by drimseq_script.R. Examples of these CSV files are located within the /ulelab/PRMT-APA/Data/Figure_1_S1_S2_S3/APA_CSV_files
/96hrs/ directory, organised by Figure. Ensure bedtools is installed and available on your system before running this script.
The all_polyA_sites_SAMPLE_NAME_coords_annotated.bed bed files generated by this script are required as input for the classification_of_APA_event.R script.

3rd step - classification_of_APA_events.R
This step classifies your APA events of interest as TUTR, ALE, MIXED or iAPA. It requires three sets of input files:
- The UTR_regions_gencode_v45.bed and splice_regions_gencode_v45.bed generated by get_UTR_and_splice_sites.sh
- The all_polyA_sites_SAMPLE_NAME_coords_annotated.bed bed files generated by annotate_pA_sites.sh. Examples of these files are located in Data/Figure_1_S1_S2_S3/classification_of_APA_bed_files/96hrs/.
- The original all_polyA_sites_SAMPLE_NAME_with_change_in_usage.csv CSV files generated by drimseq.R. Examples of these files are located in /ulelab/PRMT-APA/Data/Figure_1_S1_S2_S3/APA_CSV_files/.
