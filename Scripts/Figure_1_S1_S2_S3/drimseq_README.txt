##### README for drimseq.R script #####

Ensure all packages listed at the top of the script are installed and loaded on your system.

This script requires three sets of input files:

- count .bed files (such as those located in the /ulelab/PRMT-APA/Data/Figure_1_S1_S2_S3/counts/96hrs/ directory). These are generated by running the nf-quantseq pipeline on your 3' RNA-seq fastq files.
- a poly(A) site atlas file, titled merged_polya.filteredunique.annotated.bed (such as those found in the /ulelab/PRMT-APA/Data/Figure_1_S1_S2_S3/pA_atlases/ directory). This file is also generated by the nf-quantseq pipeline, and contains all poly(A) sites identified by the pipeline.
- a metadata .txt file containing information regarding the samples you want to input into DRIMSeq. The metadata files used to run DRIMSeq on the samples in the paper 'PRMT activity promotes global 3â€™ UTR shortening in proliferating cells, Griffith et al., 2025' are present in /ulelab/PRMT-APA/Data/Figure_1_S1_S2_S3/. This file should be made up of two columns: SampleName (containing the name of each sample, including replicate information), and Condition (containing each condition that you want to compare).

The CSV files generated by this script are required as input files for the classification_of_APA_events.R script also found in this directory.
